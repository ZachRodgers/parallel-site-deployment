                            Portions of the Operator Portal now include AI-driven assistants (“Parallel AI Agents”) that can propose task summaries,
                            draft responses, or prepare operational changes such as rate adjustments or registry updates. These automations rely on the
                            operational data you provide and the prompts you configure. AI output is generated on a best-effort basis and may include
                            errors or omissions. You remain responsible for reviewing every AI recommendation, confirming any suggested action, and
                            ensuring that downstream updates are accurate and lawful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By enabling an AI Agent you (a) authorize Parallel to process the relevant lot data in order to craft prompts and payload
                            templates, (b) acknowledge that all confirmations are logged for auditing and abuse prevention, and (c) agree not to use
                            AI tools to circumvent applicable law, parking rules, or these Terms. We may temporarily disable AI access for accounts
                            that misuse the feature or when additional safeguards are required.
